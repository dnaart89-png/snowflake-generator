    <h1>About Nameflake Studio</h1>

    <p>
      Nameflake Studio began with a simple idea:  
      <strong>to turn meaningful words into beautiful, snowflake-inspired art.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      What started as a fun creative experiment quickly grew into a tool that people use
      for crafts, gifts, classroom projects, ornaments, logos, and heartfelt keepsakes.
      Every snowflake is unique — just like every name it comes from — and that sense of
      individuality is at the heart of this project.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Snowflakes?</h2>
    <p>
      Snowflakes are symbols of beauty, creativity, and uniqueness.  
      When you place a name into Nameflake Studio, the design forms something new every time —
      delicate, surprising, and one-of-a-kind.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s a creative way to preserve memories, celebrate loved ones, and make art
      that feels personal.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Created It?</h2>
    <p>
      Nameflake Studio was created by someone who loves blending art, storytelling,
      and digital design into tools that spark joy.  
      What started as a personal side project grew into a place where thousands of people
      can come to create something meaningful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every update is made with care — improving the generator, adding new features,
      and making sure the site is enjoyable for everyone.
    </p>
